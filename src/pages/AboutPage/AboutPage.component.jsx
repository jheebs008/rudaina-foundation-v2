            I wanted to take a minute and explain the name of this foundation. Rudaina was the name of my cousin. She suffered from Infant Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) as a result of pregnancy related complications. The doctors gave her a life expectancy of just a couple of years. In 2017, she passed away at the age of 20. Her life was a miracle, she defied all odds.<br/><br/>
            Even though Rudaina couldnâ€™t speak, was paralyzed from the neck down, and bed written her whole life, she always had a smile on her face. I remember playing games with her at a young age, some of my most cherished memories. After she passed, I was inspired by the pain it brought me that I made it my mission to try and help other families that are going through something similar.<br/><br/>
            The Rudaina Foundation will not just focus on HIE cases, it will develop and grow to help anyone that is going through something so emotional and painful during the most beautiful process of life. Whether that help comes from financial resources or through a foundation that can provide support, Rudaina will always be in my heart and will forever fuel my fire to help and contribute all my potential to someone in need.
